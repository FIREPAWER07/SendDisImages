A **modern, lightweight, and efficient Discord Bot GUI** built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/).  
**SendDisImages** lets you send one or multiple high-quality images to Discord channels through your bot — automatically compressing them, respecting Nitro limits, and running entirely locally with minimal CPU, GPU, and RAM usage.
